Probably everyone but me.</p>

Client requests made in person, over the phone, and through emails, really required me to sharpen my communication skills in every regard. I'm comfortable to discuss requests and teamwork strategies with the stakeholders around me because of the service desk.

						<h3 class="full">University Experience</h3>
						<p class="full">During my time in the university so far, I've come to enjoy my circuits courses greatly. This feeling about the topic could stem from the concept of creativity, which is also a reason why I've come to enjoy programming so much! There's something magical about creating fundamental building blocks, and stacking them or augmenting them for a greater purpose. What proves frustrating in the problem solving process, becomes total relief and ecstasy once the solution has been achieved.</p>
						<br><br><span class="full">Below is a list of courses which have contributed to me feeling this way:</span>
						<ul class="full">
							<li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
							<li>Digital Circuits and Systems</li>
							<li>Digital Computers</li>
							<li>Electronic Circuits 1</li>
							<li>Electronic Circuits 2</li>
